DESCRIPTION:

	Demonstrates the use of Bit Manipulation Engine (BME) on the FRDM KL25Z.

TESTED ON:

	- KL25Z

	- IAR EWARM 6.50.6

	- Keil uVision 4.71.2.0

	- PE Micro DEBUG-APP_Pemicro_v106.SDA

	- Memory Targets:

		FLASH_128KB

REQUIREMENTS:

	- KL25Z development board running PEmicro Debug Application (See OPENSDAUG.pdf for instructions to install debug app.)

	- Terminal application e.g., Hercules, PuTTY

	- Mini USB cable for OpenSDA debugging & powering the KL25Z
 

SETUP:

	Terminal:
		- Open up Device Manager to check COM port name of 'OpenSDA - CDC Serial port'. e.g., COM1, COM2, etc..
		- Baudrate: 	19200 (Check 'freedom.h'/'tower.h' macro 'TERMINAL_BAUD' for baudrate setting.)
		- Data size: 	8 bits
		- Parity:	none
		- Handshake:	OFF	(Called 'Flow control' in PuTTY, set to 'None'.)

BEHAVIOR:

	The terminal should display the standard target description followed by a line stating "Running the LQRUG_bme_ex1" project."
	Following this the application should display the start and end values of the SYSTICK for various operations performed in both 
	normal C and using BME macros.

	Tested operations are: 
		
		Logic
		BFI - Bit Field Insert
		LAS1 - Load-And-Set 1 bit
		UBFX - Unsigned Bit Field Extract		
			
ADDITIONAL NOTES:

	IAR: 	Make sure IAR and FREEDOM (or TOWER) are defined in the preprocessor.

	Keil: 	Make sure KEIL, FREEDOM (or TOWER) and CMSIS are defined in the preprocessor.
