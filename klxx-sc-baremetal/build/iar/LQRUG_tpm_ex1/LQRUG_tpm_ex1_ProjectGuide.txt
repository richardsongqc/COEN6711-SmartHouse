DESCRIPTION:

	Demonstrates PWM generation and capture using TPM0 & TMP1 on the KL25Z.

TESTED ON:

	- KL25Z

	- IAR EWARM 6.50.6

	- PE Micro DEBUG-APP_Pemicro_v106.SDA

	- Memory Targets:

		FLASH_128KB
		FLASH_64KB
		FLASH_32KB

REQUIREMENTS:

	- KL25Z development board running PEmicro Debug Application (See OPENSDAUG.pdf for instructions to install debug app.)

	- Terminal application e.g., Hercules, PuTTY

	- Mini USB cable for OpenSDA debugging & powering the FRDM KL26Z

	- Jumper wires to connect TPM0 & TPM1

	- Optional: Oscilloscope to observe PWM signals
 

SETUP:

	Terminal:
		- Open up Device Manager to check COM port name of 'OpenSDA - CDC Serial port'. e.g., COM1, COM2, etc..
		- Baudrate: 	115200 (Check 'freedom.h' macro 'TERMINAL_BAUD' for baudrate setting.)
		- Data size: 	8 bits
		- Parity:	none
		- Handshake:	OFF	(Called 'Flow control' in PuTTY, set to 'None'.)

	freedom.h/tower.h:
		- Make sure NO_PLL_INIT is defined
		- freedom.h/tower.h are local project file, not the platform file	  

BEHAVIOR:
 
		- TPM0 used in PWM mode,
               	- both CH1 (PTC2) and CH2 (PTC3) outputs used,
               	- CH0 of TPM0 configured as normal PWM (high-true pulses)
               	- CH1 of TPM0 configured as inverted PWM (low-true pulses)
               	- duty cycle of PWM signal is set by UART0
               	- TPM1 used in input capture mode, 
               	- both CH0 (PTA12) and CH1 (PTA13) inputs used,
               	- both channels configured to capture rising edge
               	- if output channel of TPM0 module is interconnected with both of
               	  TMP1 (PTC2<->PTA12 and PTC2<->PTA13) pulse width can be measured.
               	- NOTE: if PTA12 and PTA13 are not connected to the source of 
                  pulses, pulse witdth measurement is not possible.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

	IAR: 	Make sure IAR and FREEDOM (or TOWER) are defined in the preprocessor.
