DESCRIPTION:

	Demonstrates the use of UART0 wake up using character match from VLPS  on the KL25Z.

TESTED ON:

	- KL25Z

	- IAR EWARM 6.50.6

	- PE Micro DEBUG-APP_Pemicro_v106.SDA

	- Memory Targets:

		FLASH_128KB
		FLASH_64KB
		FLASH_32KB

REQUIREMENTS:

	- KL25Z development board running PEmicro Debug Application (See OPENSDAUG.pdf for instructions to install debug app.)

	- Terminal application capable of sending raw hexidecimal values e.g., Hercules

	- Mini USB cable for OpenSDA debugging & powering the KL25Z
 

SETUP:

	Terminal:
		- Open up Device Manager to check COM port name of 'OpenSDA - CDC Serial port'. e.g., COM1, COM2, etc..
		- Baudrate: 	9600 (Check 'freedom.h' macro 'TERMINAL_BAUD' for baudrate setting.)
		- Data size: 	8 bits
		- Parity:	none
		- Handshake:	OFF	(Called 'Flow control' in PuTTY, set to 'None'.)

	freedom.h/tower.h:
		- Make sure NO_PLL_INIT is defined
		- freedom.h/tower.h are local project file, not the platform file

BEHAVIOR:

	- MCGIRCLK output enabled for UART,
	- UART0 with RDRF interrupt generated (9600kbps, 8-bit, no parity),
	- match address operation used to wake up from low power mode,
	- to enter VLPS 'e' or 'E' have to be send to UART0,
	- to wake up from send 0x81 or 0xAA (address with address mark)		
			
ADDITIONAL NOTES:

	IAR: 	Make sure IAR and FREEDOM (or TOWER) are defined in the preprocessor.
