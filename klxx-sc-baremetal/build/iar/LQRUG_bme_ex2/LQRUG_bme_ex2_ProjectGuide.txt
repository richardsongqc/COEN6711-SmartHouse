DESCRIPTION:

	Demonstrates the use of Bit Manipulation Engine (BME) on the KL25Z.

TESTED ON:

	- KL25Z

	- IAR EWARM 6.50.6

	- Keil uVision 4.71.2.0 (NOT WORKING)

	- PE Micro DEBUG-APP_Pemicro_v106.SDA

	- Memory Targets:

		FLASH_128KB

REQUIREMENTS:

	- KL25Z development board running PEmicro Debug Application (See OPENSDAUG.pdf for instructions to install debug app.)

	- Terminal application e.g., Hercules, PuTTY

	- Mini USB cable for OpenSDA debugging & powering the FRDM KL25Z
 

SETUP:

	Terminal:
		- Open up Device Manager to check COM port name of 'OpenSDA - CDC Serial port'. e.g., COM1, COM2, etc..
		- Baudrate: 	19200 (Check 'freedom.h'/'tower.h' macro 'TERMINAL_BAUD' for baudrate setting.)
		- Data size: 	8 bits
		- Parity:	none
		- Handshake:	OFF	(Called 'Flow control' in PuTTY, set to 'None'.)

BEHAVIOR:

	ATTENTION: Board will not wake up from VLLS if you are in a debug session. Will only funcion after download and POR.
				
	The project will start with Normal initialization of the ADC, GPIO, and Low Power Timer. If DEBUG_PRINT is defined the
	project will print out the execution cycle for initialization. If using a Freedom board, there is no potentiometer
	on the board so the user will then press any key (must be a key that has an ASCII character) to continue. Then the user
	must enter 'l' (lower case L) to enter VLLS mode. To wake up from VLLS mode on the KL25Z, press SW1. The code will 
	then execute the same process using BME macros to initialize the ADC, GPIO, and Low Power Timer.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

	IAR: 	Make sure IAR and FREEDOM (or TOWER) are defined in the preprocessor.

	Keil: 	Make sure KEIL, FREEDOM (or TOWER) and CMSIS are defined in the preprocessor.
