DESCRIPTION:

	Demonstrates the use of UART0 using polling and interrupt methods on the KL25Z.

TESTED ON:

	- KL25Z

	- IAR EWARM 6.50.6

	- PE Micro DEBUG-APP_Pemicro_v106.SDA

	- Memory Targets:

		FLASH_128KB
		FLASH_64KB
		FLASH_32KB

REQUIREMENTS:

	- KL25Z development board running PEmicro Debug Application (See OPENSDAUG.pdf for instructions to install debug app.)

	- Terminal application e.g., Hercules, PuTTY

	- Mini USB cable for OpenSDA debugging & powering the KL25Z
 

SETUP:

	Terminal:
		- Open up Device Manager to check COM port name of 'OpenSDA - CDC Serial port'. e.g., COM1, COM2, etc..
		- Baudrate: 	115200 (Check 'freedom.h' macro 'TERMINAL_BAUD' for baudrate setting.)
		- Data size: 	8 bits
		- Parity:	none
		- Handshake:	OFF	(Called 'Flow control' in PuTTY, set to 'None'.)

	freedom.h/tower.h:
		- Make sure NO_PLL_INIT is defined
		- freedom.h/tower.h are local project file, not the platform file

BEHAVIOR:

	User enters characters into the terminal application, and they are echoed back by the KL25Z. User must select POLLING_MODE,
	or INTERRUPT_MODE at time of build.		
			
ADDITIONAL NOTES:

	IAR: 	Make sure IAR and FREEDOM (or TOWER) are defined in the preprocessor.
